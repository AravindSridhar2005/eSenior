# eSenior Backend Dev Django Code

To test this code on your local machine: <br> <br>

(Note: If you have already completed these steps before and want to update your files to my changes, just type "git pull"!)<br> <br> 

(Messages in quotes are to be entered in the command line) <br> <br>

1. Clone this repository using "git clone [link]" and cd to the folder that was just created(in most cases, typing "cd eSenior" will work). <br> <br> 
2. Use "git checkout vishal" to enter my branch. <br> <br>
2. Once you have entered my branch, check if you have Python installed by using "python --version". If not, install Python. <br> <br>
3. Type "pip install virtualenv" to install the virtualenv library. <br> <br>
4. Check that you are in my project's directory in the command line, and then type "virtualenv env" to create a virtualenv for the project. <br> <br>
5. Once the virtualenv has been created, type "env\Scripts\activate.bat" to activate the virtual environment. You should now see an (env) before the
filepath if you are using Windows command line. <br> <br>
